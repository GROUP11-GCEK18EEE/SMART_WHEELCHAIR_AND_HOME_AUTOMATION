# SMART_WHEELCHAIR_AND_HOME_AUTOMATION
We are proposing an automated working prototype of a smart wheelchair and home automation system that can be controlled by eye-tracking. The prototype shall be designed for paralyzed people with only motor functions for eye movement. We are also considering making the wheelchair aware of its surroundings, obstructions and making decisions accordingly.
